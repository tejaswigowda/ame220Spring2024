# Assignment 5
`Due Feb 28th, before class`


## Tasks

Starting with the code handout (`code` folder) from the class, implement the slide show fading animation.



## Hints

0. No additional markup necessary.
You may or may not need to:
1. add css specific to `body.fading`
2. edit the `main()` and `goToCurrentSlide()` functions in `index.html` to add the fading effect.
